Introduction
------------

These are my derivations of Fabien 'Ryg's rANS coder plus a
static arithmetic coder derived from Eugene Shelwein's work.
Therefore none of the really complex stuff is my own and the real
credit belongs elsewhere.

The originals can be found at:
-    https://github.com/rygorous/ryg_rans
-    http://ctxmodel.net (defunct?)

I thought about forking this, but I didn't do that way back when I
first created my variants and so it'd be a fork in name only, with no
actual history.

The arithmetic coder was designed to be a fast unrolled variant that
coded using multiple arithmetic coders simultaneously. I also
implemented a static order-1 model in addition to the usual order-0.

About the same time I'd finished that code the ANS implementations
started arriving so I took Ryg's original rANS (two way interleaved
variant) and produced a 4-way interleaved version.  Successive
optimisations lead version "4c".  Most recently I explored some newer
tweaks and ideas.

- arith_static.c
	The unrolled order-0/1 arithmetic coder.

- rANS_static4x8.c
	A 4-way unrolled order-0/1 rANS coder with 8-bit renormalisation.
	This is compatible with the rANS_static4c (and 4j) variants
	used in CRAM, but more heavily optimised with additional
	assembly.

- rANS_static4x16.c
	A variant of the rANS_static4 code that uses 16-bit
	renormalisation.  It is incompatible with the 4x8 output.
	This is the same idea used in Ryg's SIMD variant; by keeping
	the rANS state as 15+16 instead of 23+8 we only ever have one
	normalisation step instead of two.  This also uses assembly.

	Note that to further test the maximum performance of order-1
	encoding, the table sizes were reduced to 9 bits for 4x16
	instead of 12 bits used in order-0 (and 12 in both order-0 and
	order-1 in 4x8).  Thus the two are not directly comparable
	with the order-1 method.

- rANS_static64c.c, rans64.h
	A 4 way unrolled version of Ryg's rans64.h.
	(This needs a mulhi cpu instruction to do 64-bit by 64-bit
	multiplication and take the top 64-bits of the result.
	Available on most(all?) x86_64 architectures, but I needed to
	consider 32-bit hosts too.)

Usage
-----

The rANS_test.c file builds the rANS_static test application.  This
has -8 and -16 parameters to control 8 and 16 bit renormalisation
values, using the code above.  It is also possible to build
rANS_static4c, rANS_static4j and rANS_static64c test executables with
"make old", but these are included only for testing older code
variants.

Order 0 encoding and decoding

    rANS_static -o0 in in.rans0
    rANS_static -d in.rans0 in.decoded

Order 1 encoding and decoding

    rANS_static -o0 in in.rans1
    rANS_static -d in.rans1 in.decoded

Testing/benchmarking order 1

    rANS_static -o1 -t in

Tested on an "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz" (from
/proc/cpuinfo on Ubuntu Trusty).

rANS_static4x8 and rANS_static4x16 refer to the source/algorithm
files, tested by rANS_static -8 and rANS_static -16 executables
respectively.

rANS_static4x16-10 vs rANS_static4x16-9 is a change from 10 to 9 for
the TF_SHIFT_O1 parameter. (The O0 parameter is kept at 12.)
This reduces table lookup size and has a substantial speed improvement
to the decompression times, but at a cost of poorer accuracy in coding
leading to larger files.

Also if cache memory is tight on your CPU, consider switching to the
rans_uncompress_O1c_4x16() function instead of rans_uncompress_O1_sfb_4x16()
or changing ssym[] array to be uint8_t instead of uint16_t in sfb.  (This
will work just fine as 8-bit instead, but seems to be slower on my
system.)
